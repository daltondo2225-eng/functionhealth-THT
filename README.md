# Tasks — Take-Home Submission

A small to-do task management application: ASP.NET Core 8 backend with SQLite + EF Core, React 18 + Vite + TypeScript frontend, JWT-bearer authentication. Optimised for clarity and correctness over architectural surface area.

## Quickstart (Docker — one command)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open <http://localhost:5173>. Register an account, sign in, and start adding tasks. The SQLite database lives at `./data/todos.db` and survives container restarts.

To stop and wipe state: `docker compose down && rm -rf data/`.

## Local development (no Docker)

Two terminals.

```bash
# 1. Backend — needs .NET 8 SDK installed
cd backend
export Jwt__Secret="dev-only-secret-do-not-use-in-production-please-replace-min-32"
dotnet run --project TodoApi
# listens on http://localhost:8080
```

```bash
# 2. Frontend — needs Node 20+
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173, proxies /api to :8080
```

If you don't have .NET 8 installed locally, the Docker path is the one-command equivalent.

## API contract

All non-2xx responses use a single error envelope:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "validation_failed", "message": "Title is required.", "details": { "Title": ["Title is required."] } } }
```

| Method | Path                  | Auth | Body                                              | Success         | Errors                |
| ------ | --------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/auth/register`  | no   | `{ email, password }`                             | `200 { token, user }` | 400, 409              |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`     | no   | `{ email, password }`                             | `200 { token, user }` | 400, 401              |
| GET    | `/api/todos`          | yes  | —                                                 | `200 [TodoDto]`       | 401                   |
| POST   | `/api/todos`          | yes  | `{ title, description? }`                         | `201 TodoDto`         | 400, 401              |
| GET    | `/api/todos/{id}`     | yes  | —                                                 | `200 TodoDto`         | 401, 404              |
| PUT    | `/api/todos/{id}`     | yes  | `{ title, description?, isCompleted }`            | `200 TodoDto`         | 400, 401, 404         |
| DELETE | `/api/todos/{id}`     | yes  | —                                                 | `204`                 | 401, 404              |
| GET    | `/health`             | no   | —                                                 | `200 { status }`      | —                     |

`TodoDto = { id, title, description, isCompleted, createdAt, updatedAt }` — `createdAt` / `updatedAt` are ISO-8601 UTC strings produced by the server.

## Trust model

Every protected endpoint resolves the current user **only** from the JWT `sub` claim — never from the request body, query, or path. Every query is scoped by `UserId`:

```csharp
var todo = await db.Todos.FirstOrDefaultAsync(t => t.Id == id && t.UserId == userId);
if (todo is null) throw AppException.NotFound();
```

Cross-user access returns **404, not 403**, on purpose: a 403 leaks the fact that the resource exists. The integration tests in [backend/TodoApi.Tests/OwnershipTests.cs](backend/TodoApi.Tests/OwnershipTests.cs) prove this for read, update, and delete and also verify that the underlying row is unchanged after a hijacking attempt.

Login uses an identical 401 message for "no such email" and "wrong password" to prevent user enumeration. Passwords are hashed with BCrypt (work factor 11). JWTs are HS256-signed with a 12-hour lifetime; the secret is required to be ≥32 characters and the app refuses to start otherwise.

**Token storage trade-off.** The JWT is kept in `localStorage` rather than an httpOnly cookie. The trade is convenience and zero CSRF surface against a slightly larger XSS blast radius if the SPA ever ships an XSS bug. For an SPA on a separate origin from the API this is a defensible default; the production-grade alternative — httpOnly + Secure + SameSite cookie with a CSRF token — is listed under "What I'd add for production." All user-rendered text in the app is React-escaped and we keep no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage, so the XSS surface today is small.

## Architecture decisions

- **Flat, not layered.** Minimal API endpoints (`Endpoints/*.cs`) talk to EF Core directly. No `IRepository`, no `IService` — those abstractions don't solve a real problem here.
- **Single error envelope** is produced by one middleware ([Errors/ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs](backend/TodoApi/Errors/ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs)) plus an `AppException` type with factory methods. Validation uses DataAnnotations (`Errors/Validation.cs`), no FluentValidation. On the client side, [`api/client.ts`](frontend/src/api/client.ts) sets a 15s timeout and normalises every failure mode to the same `{ code, message, details? }` shape — 502/503/504 (e.g. backend down) becomes "Backend is unavailable", timeouts become "Request timed out", and network failures become "Network error" — so the UI never has to think about HTTP plumbing.
- **TanStack Query** on the frontend caches the todo list under one key. Every mutation invalidates that key so the UI always renders backend truth — no optimistic updates, no client-side merging, no drift between create/update and list view.
- **`localStorage` for the JWT** and a tiny `AuthContext` for hydration and sign-out. The axios client attaches the token automatically and clears + redirects to `/login` on any 401.
- **Edit form drafts are local component state** and are deliberately *not* reset on a failed save — see [TodoItem.tsx](frontend/src/components/TodoItem.tsx) and the corresponding test in [TodosPage.test.tsx](frontend/src/__tests__/TodosPage.test.tsx).
- **Status filter (All / Active / Completed) + "X of Y done" counter** are client-side over the already-fetched list. No server-side `?status=` query param, no contract drift between layers; if the list ever grew beyond a few hundred items, this is where you'd add a server-side filter, and the test in [TodosPage.test.tsx](frontend/src/__tests__/TodosPage.test.tsx) would be updated in lockstep.

## Trade-offs / scope choices

| Skipped | Why |
| ------- | --- |
| Due dates | Deliberate. The take-home guide flags timezone-sensitive date handling as a class of bug it sees fail constantly ("if you build them, build them right"). The prompt does not require dates, so omitting them eliminates that entire failure mode rather than risk a subtly-wrong implementation. The data model has room for `DueDate` as a future `DateOnly?` field. |
| Filter / sort / pagination | No real volume problem to solve at this scope; pagination state desync is itself a common failure mode, so skipping eliminates the risk. |
| Refresh tokens | A single 12-hour access token is honest for this scope. Refresh-token rotation is listed below as a "production-add." |
| Optimistic UI | Pessimistic mutations + query invalidation guarantee the list reflects backend state. Optimistic UX is nice but easy to get subtly wrong; skipping it is safer for an evaluation. |
| Roles / sharing | Not asked for. |

## What I'd add for production

- Refresh tokens with rotation; revocation table.
- Rate limiting on `/api/auth/*` (e.g. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.RateLimiting`).
- Structured logging (Serilog) with request IDs, plus OpenTelemetry traces + metrics.
- Real DB (Postgres) with connection pooling and proper migrations (`dotnet ef migrations add`).
- Audit log table for todo mutations.
- Soft-delete (`DeletedAt`) with a recovery window before hard delete.
- Email verification + password reset flow.
- CSP/HSTS/security headers at the edge (reverse proxy) and `Strict-Transport-Security`.
- Playwright end-to-end smoke covering register → create → edit → delete → logout.
- Sentry/Datadog for production error surfaces; UI error boundary too.

## Testing

```bash
# Backend — 19 integration tests using WebApplicationFactory + real SQLite (not EF InMemory)
cd backend && dotnet test
# Or via Docker:
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 dotnet test TodoApi.sln

# Frontend — 6 component tests using Vitest + RTL + MSW
cd frontend && npm test -- --run
```

The backend test factory uses a real in-memory SQLite connection (`Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` with a keepalive `SqliteConnection`), not the EF InMemory provider. This gives real constraint behaviour, real transactions, and real SQL semantics in the integration suite.

Test coverage focuses on the failure modes the rubric names:

- `AuthTests.cs` — registration, duplicate email, validation errors, login happy path, unknown-email + wrong-password 401 with the **same** message.
- `OwnershipTests.cs` — every cross-user attempt (GET, PUT, DELETE) returns 404 and the victim's row is unchanged; no-token and tampered-token both return 401.
- `TodoCrudTests.cs` — create, update, toggle, delete, and empty-title validation that doesn't corrupt the row.
- Frontend `LoginPage.test.tsx` — happy path navigation, 401 banner with typed-email preservation.
- Frontend `TodosPage.test.tsx` — list render, create + invalidate, toggle, **failed-edit-preserves-draft**, delete, status filter + done-counter.
